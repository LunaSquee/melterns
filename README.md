# Melterns
![Melterns](screenshot.png)

An in-development mod for [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/) 5.6.0+ that adds molten metals, melting, casting and creating tools. This mod is inspired by the [Tinkers Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct) mod for Minecraft, however it's a bit less-featured due to technical limitations and general lack of polish. None of the components used in this mod have been taken from TC - everything is my original creation.

**Depends on [fluid_lib](https://github.com/LunaSquee/fluid_lib)!**

## Installation
Just do `git clone https://github.com/LunaSquee/melterns.git` in your `minetest/mods` directory. You can also [download the repository](https://github.com/LunaSquee/melterns/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) but in that case you **must** change the folder name from `melterns-master` to `melterns`!

## Documentation
Official documentation currently does not exist. I recommend using a mod that shows you crafting recipes in order to know how to craft the nodes.
